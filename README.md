# c-First
First C++ Class

  Designed a clock to show both the 12 and 24 hour times with functionality to add 1 hour/minute/second. 
    
    
**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**

  --Changing both clocks at the same time was probably the most challenging aspect of this project. I had issues with pointers at the start, and took quite a while to figure out where exactly I was making an error.
  As for using tools to overcome, the multitude of libraries that are linked with C++, were crucial to finishing not only this project, but many others as well. 
  
**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**

  --The use of libraries, and loops were very helpful to learn in a practical manner, and I hope to use both moving forward. 
  
**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
  --Cutting down on some uneeded code and using functions for calling helped quite a fair bit. Adding comments in line also helped with separating parts of the code from     others. This also allowed for easier ability to make any changes.
